Generates N random points in the unit 2D-box.
Finds closest pair of points in O(n lg n) running time.
Plots the points and connects to two closest points.

This is a divide-and-conquer algorithm.
Very cool.

Command-line argument is the number of random points to create.

$ python closestPair.py 100
